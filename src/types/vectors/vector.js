/*
You can use the Vector.js library with either arrays, or the defined Vector classes associated with Vector.js
The various vector objects inherit from Array - they don't have ALL the functionality of Arrays due to quirks of how JS works
But what should be necessary has been added in using VectorBase and forcing Array functionality using call() and Array.prototype.

The benefit of using a Vector2 over something like a bare array, is that it adds some expected features like accessing coordinates by their cartesian labels (i.e. x, y, z).

/** Generic Vector - designed to be flexible enough to use as a 2d, 3d, or higher dimension vector.  
 * Actual number of dimensions is dependent on how many values are stored inside it.  
 * Vector is: 
 * - An Array (sort-of) -  Vector is a descendant of Array.
 * - Forgiving - many of it's operation methods can work with mismatched Vector lengths - smaller dimension'd vectors have missing values treated as zero. 
 * - Chainable - many of the functions provided on Vector can be chained one after the other  
 * _________
 * ```
 * let vec1 = new Vector(1,2)
 * let vec2 = new Vector(3,4)
 * let vec3 = vec1.normalize().add(vec2).subtract(vec1)
 * ```
 * _________
 * - May not work exactly like an array - some functionality may not have carried over despite extending Array - I'm still in the process of discovering what's missing. If something was missed it can probably be added back in (see how forEach is added back to Vector in the source for an example of how)
